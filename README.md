# citiesautocomplete
Auto complete EditText for cities, using Google Places


Hi there,

To run the project you only need your Google API Key.

Open "https://console.developers.google.com", login and generate your own key.

Put your key in ServerParams.class under:  

public static final String YOUR_PLACES_KEY = "YOUR_KEY";

Enjoy!
